The runtimes for tRead are much faster than sRead, but slowing than aRead.
We see that the system times for tRead are much larger than both the system
times for sRead and aRead. This implies that tRead spends more time in the
operating system because of the number of threads we create. This is why
although tRead is faster than sRead by the use of parallelism, tRead is still
slower than aRead because of its extra time spent in the operating system.
